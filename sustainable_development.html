          <p>
            The Kalp Taruh Seminar, conducted in association with Prajapita
            Brahma Kumaris Ishwariya Vishwa Vidyalaya, took place on August 16th
            from 5 to 7 PM at IIT Delhi. The event gathered more than 120
            participants who engaged in discussions on plantations, water
            purification, renewable energy, sustainable yogic agriculture, and
            sustainable living. Following the seminar, 28 dedicated volunteers
            were rewarded with saplings and pots to care for. Over three months,
            the volunteers nurtured the saplings with guidance from the Kalp
            Taruh app and instructions document. Positive feedback highlighted
            their keen interest in planting and maintaining the saplings,
            inspiring the continuation of such events. The lush green condition
            of the saplings demonstrated effective care, while participants also
            gained awareness of proper plant care and its positive impact on
            well-being.
