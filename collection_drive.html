          <p>
            The NSS IITD, in collaboration with Goonj, a renowned "India NGO of
            the year" winner, organized a successful collection drive aimed at
            gathering various goods, especially those no longer needed by
            people. The event spanned three days and involved door-to-door
            collections, sorting through donated items, and other tasks. The
            collection drive received an overwhelming response, with donations
            pouring in from every corner of the campus. The faculty and staff
            demonstrated exceptional enthusiasm and participation, contributing
            significantly to the drive's success. Moreover, the students'
            response was equally impressive, with each hostel contributing
            around 3-4 sacs of donated goods . The drive's comprehensive reach
            covered the entire campus, including all residential areas and
            hostels. Importantly, the collected items were directly distributed
            to the guards, mess workers, and other staff, ensuring that the
            contributions reached those in need.
