            to creating a more informed, compassionate, and socially conscious
            community. Initiated the impactful "Blogs of the Month" series,

          <p>
            Aarohan is an educational project aimed at assisting 11th and
            12th-grade students with their competitive exam preparations and
            board exams. The project provides quality education and
            comprehensive bilingual assignments on various topics to support the
            students' learning journey. Additionally, Aarohan promotes adult
            literacy by offering spoken English classes to the staff members of
            IIT Delhi. In its initial phase, Aarohan focused on creating
            assignments for JEE Mains/Boards and JEE Advanced. Around 50
            assignments were completed by re-recruiting old volunteers before
            regular volunteering for Phase 1 began. In the first semester, Phase
            1 volunteering was conducted to further support the students' exam
            preparations. During the course of the project, Aarohan expanded its
            impact by offering spoken English classes in collaboration with the
            EdJustice NGO. This initiative witnessed over 60 regular classes,
            benefiting students and enhancing their English language skills,
            which resulted in some students excelling in their entrance
            examinations. The project also successfully designed the curriculum
            for spoken English classes, secured the permission of IIT Delhi's
            director for conducting the classes, and collaborated with various
            NGOs in Delhi for offline classes. Aarohan's achievements include
            the preparation of more than 180 assignments, the successful conduct
            of over 60 classes with regular attendance, and the positive impact
            on students' academic performance. The project's dedication to
            quality education and adult literacy showcases its commitment to
            making a meaningful difference in the lives of the students and
            staff members at IIT Delhi.
